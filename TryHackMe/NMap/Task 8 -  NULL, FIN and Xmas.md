#scantypes 


The expected response for _open_ ports with these scans is also identical, and is very similar to that of a UDP scan. If the port is open then there is no response to the malformed packet. Unfortunately (as with open UDP ports), that is _also_ an expected behaviour if the port is protected by a firewall, so NULL, FIN and Xmas scans will only ever identify ports as being _open|filtered_, _closed_, or _filtered_. If a port is identified as filtered with one of these scans then it is usually because the target has responded with an ICMP unreachable packet.

It's also worth noting that while RFC 793 mandates that network hosts respond to malformed packets with a RST TCP packet for closed ports, and don't respond at all for open ports; this is not always the case in practice. In particular Microsoft Windows (and a lot of Cisco network devices) are known to respond with a RST to any malformed TCP packet -- regardless of whether the port is actually open or not. This results in all ports showing up as being closed.
