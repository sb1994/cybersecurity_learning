Put simply: Burp Suite is a framework written in Java that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing. In many ways, this goal is achieved as Burp is very much the industry standard tool for hands-on web app security assessments. Burp Suite is also very commonly used when assessing mobile applications, as the same features which make it so attractive for web app testing translate almost perfectly into testing the APIs (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces) powering most mobile apps.  

At the simplest level, Burp can capture and manipulate all of the traffic between an attacker and a webserver: this is the core of the framework. After capturing requests, we can choose to send them to various other parts of the Burp Suite framework -- we will be covering some of these tools in upcoming rooms. This ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests prior to them being sent to the target server (or, in some cases, the responses before they are received by our browser), makes Burp Suite perfect for any kind of manual web app testing.  

There are various different editions of Burp Suite available. We will be working with the **Burp Suite Community** edition, as this is free to use for any (legal) non-commercial use. The Burp Suite _Professional_ and _Enterprise_ editions both require expensive licenses but come with powerful extra features:
