## **What is FTP?**

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a **client-server** model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.

## What port does it use?
### **21**


## How does FTP work?

A typical FTP session operates using two channels:

-   a command (sometimes called the control) channel
-   a data channel.

As their names imply, the command channel is used for transmitting commands as well as replies to those commands, while the data channel is used for transferring data.

FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a connection with the server, the server validates whatever login credentials are provided and then opens the session.

While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the server.  

**Active vs Passive**

The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both. 

-   In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it. 
-   In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it. 

This separation of command information and data into separate channels is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having to wait for the current data transfer to finish. If both channels were interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers, which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow internet connections.

### FTP types

There are several different ways an FTP server and client software can conduct a file transfer using FTP:

-   **Anonymous FTP.** This is the most basic form of FTP. It provides support for data transfers without encrypting data or using a username and password. It's most commonly used for download of material that is allowed for unrestricted distribution. It works on [port](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/port)
-   **Password-protected FTP.** This is also a basic FTP service, but it requires the use of a username and password, though the service might not be encrypted or secure. It also works on port 21.
-   **FTP Secure (FTPS).** Sometimes referred to as FTP Secure Sockets Layer (FTP-SSL), this approach enables implicit Transport Layer Security ([TLS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Transport-Layer-Security-TLS)) as soon as an FTP connection is established. FTPS was initially used to help enable a more secure form of FTP data transfer. It typically defaults to using port 990.
-   **FTP over explicit SSL/TLS (FTPES).** This approach enables explicit TLS support by upgrading an FTP connection over port 21 to an encrypted connection. This is a commonly used approach by web and file sharing services to enable secure file transfers.
-   **Secure FTP (**[**SFTP**](https://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/SFTP-Secure-File-Transfer-Protocol)**).** This is technically not an FTP protocol, but it functions similarly. Rather, SFTP is a subset of the Secure Shell ([SSH](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Secure-Shell)) protocol that runs over port 22. SSH is commonly used by systems administrators to remotely and securely access systems and applications, and SFTP provides a mechanism within SSH for secure file transfer.
