Do Nmap scan in order to find the open ports 
```shell
#if first 1000 ports dont give anything then up the number 
nmap -p1-10000 -T3 -oN scanport 10.10.3.38
```
found that the port has been filtered so has to restart the box

If you get nothing with nmap then run telnet
```shell
telnet 10.10.179.194 8012

Trying 10.10.179.194...
