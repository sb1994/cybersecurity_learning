Windows hosts will block ICMP by default so bad actors cannot ping the IP or domain

Nmap provides an option for this: `-Pn`, which tells Nmap to not bother pinging the host before scanning it. This means that Nmap will always treat the target host(s) as being alive

**Switches that are used to get round this**:
-   `-f`:- Used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS.
-   An alternative to `-f`, but providing more control over the size of the packets: `--mtu <number>`, accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent. This _must_ be a multiple of 8.
-   `--scan-delay <time>ms`:- used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.
-   `--badsum`:- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.


Nmap switch allows you to append an arbitrary length of random data to the end of packets is --data-length
- To find this you can type **man nmap** and go to Firewall evasion tab and you can see this to your self.

In Linux if the ping gets stuck then it is not pingable
