Example: 


1. Get the location where the file is located and search for the file 
```shell
cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts

file script.db
```


Search for "smb" scripts in the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/` directory using either of the demonstrated methods.  
What is the filename of the script which determines the underlying OS of the SMB server?

```shell
## use a wild card in order to 
file smb*
```

If scripts are missing run the update command on the nmap 
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
```
